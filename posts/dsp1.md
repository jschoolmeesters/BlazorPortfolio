Welcome to my new blog! In this first post will discuss my personal goals for the coming years, which will in turn decide the course that the future content will be heading.

## Current state of affairs

At the moment I have completed the first two years of my bachelor Computing Science at Radboud University and have been working as a C# developer for roughly four years (part-time). Besides this, I have also been pursuing a carreer as a music producer. 

However, recently I decided to focus on finishing my study and find out which specialization is the best fit for me, while sharing my progress and other content on my page.

## Choosing a specialization

Personally I'm not the biggest fan of Data Science, but I would love to specialize in a future-oriented field that synergizes well with the rise of AI and cloud computing.

What are my strengths? Programming and logic.

What are my weaknesses? Calculus.

### Digital Signal Processing (DSP)

The first idea I had for a specialization was the field of Digital Signal Processing (DSP). This seemed to make a lot of sense considering that I enjoy nerding out about the most insignificant details of music production software.

Yet after doing some research (looking on Reddit) on the current state of the field and job prospects, I realised that it was not what I originally expected:
- Specializing in the technology behind DSP requires a very stong mathmatical background.
- Currently, around half of all papers published on DSP already use AI instead of traditional DSP techniques and I can only assume this to increase in the future.
- There are few DSP software engineer jobs and the pay is average.
- The field (except for AI research) seems stagnant.

### Advanced Computing and Systems

I found [this](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/master/computer-science/advanced-computing-and-systems) specialization of the master's programme Computer Science at Universiteit Leiden, called: Advanced Computing and Systems.

#### Pro's:
- Perfectly suits my strengths and weaknesses
- Future-oriented
- New and evolving field

#### Con's:
- Market that these jobs are based around is still maturing and changing

## So what's next?

Even though the master is still two years away, summer is coming, which means I can already start working on some of the requirements I'm currently lacking at:
- Excellent programming skills in C and C++, preferably at system and application levels
- Good scripting (bash, Python) and command-line skills in a Linux-based terminal environment
- Good knowledge and understanding of digital systems design fundamentals (including most topics of: binary arithmetic and codes, boolean algebra, combinational logic circuits, sequential circuits, memory basics, computer design basics)
- ~~Good knowledge and understanding of computer architecture, operating systems, and networking~~
- Basic knowledge of compiler construction and excellent skills in using compilers
- Basic knowledge of image processing
- ~~Good academic reading and writing skills; proficient in LaTeX~~
- ~~Excellent command of English, both in writing and speaking~~
- ~~Independent and critical research attitude~~
