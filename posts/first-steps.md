Welcome to my new blog! In this first post will discuss my personal goals for the coming years, which will decide the course that the future content will be heading.

## Current state of affairs

At the moment I have completed the first two years of my bachelor Computing Science at Radboud University and have been working as a C# developer for roughly four years (part-time). Besides this, I have also been trying pursuing a career as a music producer. 

However, recently I decided to focus on finishing my study and find out which specialization is the best fit for me, while sharing my progress and other content on my page.

## Choosing a specialization

Personally I'm not the biggest fan of Data Science, but I would love to specialize in a future-oriented field that synergizes well with the rise of AI and cloud computing.

What are my strengths? Programming and logic.

What are my weaknesses? Calculus.

### Digital Signal Processing (DSP)

The first idea I had for a specialization was the field of Digital Signal Processing (DSP). This seemed to make a lot of sense considering that I enjoy nerding out about the most insignificant details of music production software.

Yet after doing some research on what it the where the field sits math/programming wise, checking the current state of the field and job prospects, I realised that it was not what I originally expected.

### Advanced Computing and Systems

I found [this](https://www.universiteitleiden.nl/en/education/study-programmes/master/computer-science/advanced-computing-and-systems) specialization of the master's programme Computer Science at Universiteit Leiden, called: Advanced Computing and Systems.

#### Pro's:
- Suits my strengths and weaknesses
- Future-oriented
- New and evolving field

#### Con's:
- Not sure yet?

## So what's next?

Even though the master is still two years away, summer is coming, which means I could already start honing my C and C++ skills and work on some of the other requirements of the master (regardless of whether or not I will eventually choose it):
- Excellent programming skills in C and C++, preferably at system and application levels
- Good scripting (bash, Python) and command-line skills in a Linux-based terminal environment
- Good knowledge and understanding of digital systems design fundamentals (including most topics of: binary arithmetic and codes, boolean algebra, combinational logic circuits, sequential circuits, memory basics, computer design basics)
- ~~Good knowledge and understanding of computer architecture, operating systems, and networking~~
- Basic knowledge of compiler construction and excellent skills in using compilers
- Basic knowledge of image processing
- ~~Good academic reading and writing skills; proficient in LaTeX~~
- ~~Excellent command of English, both in writing and speaking~~
- ~~Independent and critical research attitude~~

I found the following two MIT OpenCourseWare courses to start becoming excellent at C/C++:
- [Effective Programming in C and C++](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-s096-effective-programming-in-c-and-c-january-iap-2014/)
- [Introduction to C Memory Management and C++ OOP](https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/6-088-introduction-to-c-memory-management-and-c-object-oriented-programming-january-iap-2010/)
